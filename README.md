# Academic Project Template

A template for reproducible academic projects. The idea of this template is to provide a structure 
and way of working that eases those wanting to work more reproducibly.

## Take it step by step

A large part of working reproducibly is building habits. Learning everything at once will also
be daunting and overwhelming and can hinder your adoption of reproducible practices as a result.
Building comfort with tools and practices over time and maintaing a reasonable level of challenge,
is a better recipe to succeed.
