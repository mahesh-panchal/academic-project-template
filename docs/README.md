# Documentation

A place to store documents of various kinds that you produce.

For example:
- Written:
    - Thesis
    - Website/Blog
    - Presentations
    - Journal articles
    - Posters
- Video/Audio documentation (links to where you've published them, e.g. Youtube, or Vimeo)
    - Podcasts
    - Teaching/Training

For research articles that you've read or intend to read, a 
bibliographic citation/reference manager like Zotero, Endnote, Paperpile, 
or Mendeley, is a better tool than storing them in a folder here.
