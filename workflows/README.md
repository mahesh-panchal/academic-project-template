# Code

This folder is for your code. Scripts, pipelines, and notebooks, which
are written in a way to be called from your analysis folder. 

Examples of code:
- Nextflow pipeline
- Snakemake pipeline
- Bash pipeline
- R Notebook
- Python Notebook

Workflow managers like Nextflow and Snakemake are useful for running
analyses at scale. Notebooks, are better intended for analysing refined
data, and performing statistical analyses and visualisation. Notebooks
can be used to launch pipelines in Nextflow or Snakemake too.
